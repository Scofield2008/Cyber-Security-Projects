# 🛰️ Network Supervisor (Visualizer + Anomaly Detector)

## 📌 Overview
**Network Supervisor** is an advanced Python-based tool designed for **real-time network traffic capture, visualization, and anomaly detection**.  
It combines:
- **Packet Sniffing** (via Scapy)  
- **Interactive GUI** (PyQt5 + Matplotlib)  
- **Heuristic + ML-inspired anomaly detection**  

This project is perfect for:
- Students learning **cybersecurity & network monitoring**  
- Researchers experimenting with **traffic analysis**  
- Security enthusiasts building **lightweight IDS/IPS prototypes**
