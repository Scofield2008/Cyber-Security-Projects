🐻 Winnie the Pooh – Honeypot Project
📖 Overview
Winnie the Pooh is a cybersecurity honeypot designed to attract, detect, and log malicious activity. Inspired by the famous bear’s love for honey, this project serves as a trap for attackers who “can’t resist the honey.”
The system simulates multiple services and vulnerabilities that hackers commonly target, while secretly recording their activity for analysis and defense improvements.

✨ Features
🍯 Honeypot HTTP
.Mimics a vulnerable web server.

.Logs malicious requests, payloads, and attempted exploits.

.Helps in studying web-based attack patterns (SQLi, XSS, LFI, etc.).

🔑 Honeypot SSH

.Emulates an insecure SSH server with weak/default credentials.

.Captures brute-force attempts and executed commands.

.Useful for analyzing attacker behavior once “inside” a system.

🌐 Honeypot Website

.Fake vulnerable web application hosted for attackers.

.Logs form submissions, admin panel brute-forcing, and injection attempts.

.Allows red-team/blue-team exercises.

🎹 Keylogger

.Once an attacker gains access, a silent keylogger activates.

.Records keystrokes and command inputs.

.Provides real insights into attacker intentions and next steps.

⚙️ Code Functionality

.The code is structured to simulate services and capture data:

.HTTP & Website Modules → Create fake web servers with hidden logging.

.SSH Module → Provides a fake SSH shell environment that records inputs.

.Keylogger Module → Captures keystrokes when attackers interact with the honeypot.

.Logging System → Saves IPs, timestamps, payloads, and keystrokes for later analysis.

.Each function of the code is designed to look and feel legitimate to attackers, but its hidden purpose is observation and data collection.

🎯 Purpose & Impact

🛡 Defensive Learning – Helps cybersecurity teams understand modern attack methods.

📊 Threat Intelligence – Provides raw data on attacker tools, payloads, and behaviors.

🎓 Educational Tool – Useful for students and researchers to practice ethical hacking and defense.

🌍 Community Contribution – Can contribute to global honeypot networks, strengthening security awareness.

By studying how attackers interact with Winnie the Pooh, organizations and researchers gain valuable insights into real-world threats and how to defend against them.
